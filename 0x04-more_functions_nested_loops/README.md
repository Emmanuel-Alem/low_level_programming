During my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX School, I worked on a project that helped me learn about using header files, functions, loops, and nested loops in C programming language.

The following technologies were used in this project:

gcc 4.8.4 for compiling C files
C90 standard for writing C files
Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
The project included several C programs, each with a unique filename and description. To avoid plagiarism, I cannot provide the exact code for each program. However, I can give an overview of the programs and their purpose:

0-Putchar.c: This program prints the word "Putchar" to the console.
1-alphabet.c: This program prints the lowercase alphabet to the console.
2-print_alphabet_x10.c: This program prints the lowercase alphabet 10 times to the console.
3-islower.c: This program checks whether a character is lowercase or not.
4-isalpha.c: This program checks whether a character is alphabetic or not.
5-sign.c: This program prints the sign of a given number.
6-abs.c: This program calculates and returns the absolute value of a given integer.
7-print_last_digit.c: This program prints the last digit of a given number.
8-24_hours.c: This program prints every minute of a day to the console.
9-times_table.c: This program prints the 9 times table, starting from 0.
10-add.c: This program adds two integers and returns the result.
11-print_to_98.c: This program prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98.
100-times_table.c: This program prints the multiplication table of a given number, starting from 0.
101-natural.c: This program computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.
102-fibonacci.c: This program prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting from 1 and 2.
103-fibonacci.c: This program finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence.
104-fibonacci.c: This program finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers.
All of the programs use functions, loops, and nested loops to accomplish their tasks. These are fundamental programming concepts that are widely used in many programming languages.
