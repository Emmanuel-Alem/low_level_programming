Task 0: Multiple mains
This task involves working with multiple main functions. In most projects, there is usually only one main function, but in this task, you will be working with multiple main functions to test different parts of your code.

Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe
This task involves copying a main file and commenting out the part of the code that is causing an output to go into an infinite loop. The goal is to modify the code so that it doesn't go into an infinite loop but still produces the correct output.

Task 2: 0 > 972?
This task involves writing a program that prints the largest of three integers. You will need to write a function that takes three integers as input and returns the largest one.

Task 3: Leap year
This task involves writing a program that converts a date to the day of the year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap years into consideration. You will need to write a function that takes the day, month, and year as input and returns the day of the year and the number of days left in the year.
